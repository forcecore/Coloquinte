# Prerequisites

## LEMON
* https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon
* Get lemon. Build it by reading its INSTALL documents.
* In my case, I did (not system-wide install.)
    * mkdir build  # make build directory for cmake to work
    * cd build  # get inside it
    * cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/usr/lib/lemon ..
        * Let cmake do its configuration for lemon.
        * But install prefix is specified as above command.
